## reverb
Writing an audio reverb involves creating a software algorithm that simulates the natural reverberation that occurs in a physical space. Here are the general steps for creating an audio reverb:

Define the impulse response: The impulse response is a recording of a sound source played in a physical space, and the subsequent reverb decay. To create an audio reverb, you will need to create an impulse response by playing a sound source, such as a sine wave, in a physical space and recording the resulting reverb decay.

Design the filter: The filter is a key component of the reverb algorithm, and it helps shape the frequency response of the reverb. There are many different types of filters you can use, such as low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.

Create the delay lines: Delay lines are used to simulate the multiple reflections that occur in a physical space. You will need to create multiple delay lines with different delay times, which will help create a more realistic reverb effect.

Combine the impulse response, filter, and delay lines: Once you have created the impulse response, filter, and delay lines, you can combine them to create the reverb effect. The delay lines are used to simulate the multiple reflections, while the filter helps shape the frequency response of the reverb.

Add additional features: To create a more advanced reverb effect, you can add additional features such as pre-delay, early reflections, diffusion, and modulation. These features can help create a more realistic and nuanced reverb effect.
